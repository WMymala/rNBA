This will include various files to analyze basketball(e.g. player stats, salary, correlations between salary and wins, etc.)

For .rmd #1(each rmd will be numbered), the data used is from 'nbastatR' library from R

The purpose of .rmd will be to see connections–e.g. comparisons between each country in how much free throw shooting affect 3-point shooting, if at all–between countries in most likely free throw and 3-point shooting percentage.
